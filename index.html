                <h2 class="title">About</h2>
                <h3 class="stamfirst">CL Max is a safety and human factors consultancy. It was founded by Harry Nelson, an acknowledged operational expert in the aviation and transport sectors. From the office in Toulouse, CL Max brings more than five decades of experience, knowledge and insight from all levels of the aviation industry. Integrity, trust and openness form the bedrock of the way we operate. </h3>
                <p class="text">The concept of CL Max is to encourage organisations and individuals to have an awareness of what they are capable of when working at maximum capacity. Delivering peak performance cannot be sustained over prolonged periods, therefore learning to modulate personal effort, whilst knowing one’s absolute limit is a healthy and safe way of achieving collective performance improvement.</p><p class="text">Our aim is to ensure that organisations benefit from the latent talent and untapped value that exists within each of their individual team members. We aim to maximise the available performance and collective capability of any group of people, by bringing enjoyment, shared intent and purpose to their work.</p>

                <h3 class="stamfirst">CL Max defines, leads and facilitates projects that directly improve safety and the understanding of human performance in a wide range of global organisations. Working mainly within the aerospace industry, we deliver both traditional interview-led reviews and recommendations, but also innovative methods to encourage new ways for organisations looking to improve performance and safety.</h3>
                <p class="first-text">We seek long-term relationships with clients, ensuring that our recommendations are implemented, a continual assessment and review of our proposals is maintained and real change is achieved.</p><p class="text">CL Max is also part of a working group named CORE - Consortium of Respected Experts. All members of CORE have similar values and have been brought together by CL Max, in an informal environment for their complimentary skill and knowledge sets. All stand ready to assist in specialist areas. If it is felt that another member of CORE would provide a better service, we will not hesitate to recommend the right person or team.</p><p class="text">Harry also speaks regularly at dinners and conferences around the world. Using a variety of aviation related topics from safety events, through experimental test flying to change management and business culture, he aims to act as a catalyst to improve human performance. His “lessons learnt” stories are all based on real events and demonstrate what can go wrong, and right, in aviation.</p>
